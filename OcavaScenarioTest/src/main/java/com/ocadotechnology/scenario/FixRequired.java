/**
 * This annotation can be used to identify tests that are currently expected to fail. When this annotation is applied
 * to a test that throws an exception during execution of its steps then the test will be marked as "passed" and vice versa.
 * This allows still valid, yet failing, tests to be highlighted so that the test/implementation can be updated as required.
 * Errors encountered outside of executing the test steps (such as unsupported combinations of check step modifiers) will cause
 * the test to fail as normal.
 *
 * A test which is failing intermittently (e.g. due to random seed instability) should be {@link Disabled} instead.
