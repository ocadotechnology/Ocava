     * <p>This is a convenience method for use where by reaching a point in a function, something has gone wrong and an
     * exception should be thrown. This is preferable to just throwing an exception purely for ease of breakpointing.
     * This is because it is easy to breakpoint on Precondition failures, whereas breakpointing on general exception
     * creation would mean hitting some that are expected (thrown and caught by libraries you use - nothing you can do
     * about it).
     *
     * <p>Having this method return a RuntimeException means that you can throw it, meaning that your function will not
     * also demand a return.
     *
     * <p>Usage:
     * <pre>{@code throw Failer.fail("Something has gone terribly wrong");}</pre>
     * Or:
     * <pre>{@code throw Failer.fail("Something has gone terribly wrong with %s and %s", someVariable, someOtherVariable);}</pre>
