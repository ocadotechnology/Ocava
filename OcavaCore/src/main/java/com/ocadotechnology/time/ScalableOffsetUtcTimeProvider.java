 * Provides a time based on realtime but offset and optionally scaled based on user specification
 *
 * Given a multiplier of 2, this will mean that for every 1 second that passes in realtime, 2 seconds will pass on
 * this time provider.
 *
 * This multiplier can be used for modelling more or less computing (network/cpu) resources within a realtime simulation
 * as execution events can be given longer or shorter amounts of times to be computed in.
 * In realtime systems that are highly unconstrained by system resources, this time provider allows for the simulation
 * to be run faster.
